* bash-itunes 1.2.2 (2013-03-29-00:47)
  * Substring matching:
    * "itunes play <song>" and "itunes playlist <playlist>" now look
      for tracks or playlists containing the search term if an exact
      match fails, eg: "itunes play fire" will play track "fuel my fire"
      if it doesn't find a track named "fire".
  * Only perform option parsing and subcommand dispatch if run directly;
    as opposed to being sourced by another script.
  * Add test suite.
  * Correctly escape search term in "itunes search" for use in AppleScript.
